            <h2>Natural Analogies to Algorithmic Concepts</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Iteration in Nature:</strong> The recurring cycle of seasons exemplifies iteration, mirroring a loop in an algorithm that executes instructions repeatedly.</li>
                <li><strong>Recursion in Nature:</strong> The growth pattern of cabbage leaves reflects recursion, with each layer building upon the previous, similar to a recursive function.</li>
                <li><strong>Backtracking in Nature:</strong> Ants searching for food demonstrate backtracking, retreating to try alternative paths when unsuccessful.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>SDG Goal 11: Smart City Solutions</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Goal:</strong> Make cities and human settlements inclusive, safe, resilient, and sustainable.</li>
                <li><strong>Target:</strong> Provide access to safe, affordable, accessible, and sustainable transport systems for all by 2030.</li>
                <li><strong>Indicator:</strong> Proportion of population with convenient access to public transport, by sex, age, and persons with disabilities.</li>

            <h2>Smart City Solutions: Identified Business Cases</h2>
            <h3>1. Smart Parking Systems</h3>
            <p><strong>Problem:</strong> Traffic congestion due to inefficient parking space management and lack of real-time availability information.</p>
            <p><strong>Solution:</strong> Smart parking systems utilizing tries and dynamic queues to optimize parking availability and direct vehicles to open spots in real-time.</p>

            <h4>Algorithmic Applications:</h4>
            <h5>Parking Slot Availability using Trie</h5>
            <p><strong>Functionality:</strong> A trie efficiently stores and retrieves parking slots based on location and type (e.g., compact, regular, or handicapped).</p>
            <p><strong>Example Usage:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Each node in the trie represents a level of detail (e.g., city > parking lot > slot number).</li>
                <li>Quick lookup for the nearest available parking slot in a specific area.</li>
            </ul>

            <h5>Dynamic Queue for Real-time Slot Allocation</h5>
            <p><strong>Functionality:</strong> A queue dynamically manages the order of vehicles waiting for parking slots.</p>
            <p><strong>Example Usage:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Vehicles are queued as they approach the parking area.</li>
                <li>As slots become available, the queue ensures that the nearest or most eligible vehicle is allocated a spot based on priority (e.g., arrival time or special needs).</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>2. EV Charging Station Management</h3>
            <p><strong>Problem:</strong> Efficient management of EV charging stations to support the growing adoption of electric vehicles.</p>
            <p><strong>Solution:</strong> Smart management using tries and dynamic queues for real-time allocation and efficient utilization of charging slots.</p>

            <h4>Algorithmic Applications:</h4>
            <h5>EV Charging Slot Availability using Trie</h5>
            <p><strong>Functionality:</strong> A trie efficiently stores and retrieves EV charging slots based on location, type, and availability.</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Each node in the trie represents a level of detail (e.g., city > charging station > slot number).</li>
                <li>Quick lookup for the nearest available charging station or slot.</li>
