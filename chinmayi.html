        <h1>Course Reflections</h1>
    </header>

    <section id="nature" class="hover-effect">
        <h3>1. What are the kinds of problems we see in nature? (iteration, recursion, backtracking)?</h3>
        <p><span class="highlight"></span> Nature provides numerous examples that parallel the concepts of iteration, recursion, and backtracking in computational terms. The recurring cycle of seasons, which progresses and repeats predictably each year, is a clear representation of iteration. Similarly, the growth pattern of cabbage leaves, where each layer forms upon the previous one in a structured sequence, embodies recursion—a process building upon itself. Ants foraging for food illustrate backtracking; they traverse paths in search of resources and, upon encountering obstacles or dead ends, retrace their steps to explore alternative routes. These examples showcase how fundamental algorithmic principles are intricately mirrored in natural processes, emphasizing the profound connection between computational logic and the patterns observed in the natural world.</p>

        <h3>2. What is space and time efficiency? Why are they important? Explain the different classes of problems and orders of growth?</h3>
        <p><span class="highlight"></span> 
            <li>Space Complexity: Additional memory an algorithm requires during execution 
            Time Complexity: The duration it takes for an algorithm to complete its task. These measures are crucial for assessing an algorithm's efficiency, enabling programmers to determine its suitability for specific applications. </li>
            <li>The orders of growth of an algorithm describe how time or space requirements grow as the input size increases.</li>
            <li><strong>O(1)</strong> -> Constant order of growth</li>
            <li><strong>O(n)</strong> -> Linear order of growth</li>
            <li><strong>O(log n)</strong> -> Logarithmic order of growth.</li>
        </p>
        <h3>3. Take away from different design principles from chapter 2?</h3>
        <p><span class="highlight"></span> Studying different algorithms has helped me grasp their key principles and applications more clearly. For example, AVL trees and Red-Black trees taught me how maintaining balance in data structures is essential for efficient operations. Exploring graph traversal methods like DFS and BFS showed how different strategies can solve problems effectively—DFS being more exploratory and BFS taking a systematic approach. Learning sorting algorithms like Merge Sort, which divides and merges data, and Quick Sort, which strategically swaps elements, gave me a better understanding of how they work in practice. These concepts have provided me with a solid foundation in understanding algorithms and their practical uses.</p>
        <h3>4. The hierarchical data and how different tree data structures solve and optimize over problem scenarios (tree, bst, avl, 2-3, red-black, heap, trie)</h3>
        <p><span class="highlight"></span>Studying different algorithms has helped me grasp their key principles and applications more clearly. For example, AVL trees and Red-Black trees taught me how maintaining balance in data structures is essential for efficient operations.

These concepts have provided me with a solid foundation in understanding algorithms and their practical uses.</p>

        <h3>5. The need for array query algorithms and their implications. Their applications and principles need to be discussed.</h3>
        <p><span class="highlight"></span>Efficient array queries are crucial for managing large datasets with frequent updates. Lookup tables precompute and store results for fast range queries, while segment trees handle dynamic updates efficiently. A simpler alternative is the Binary Indexed Tree (BIT), which uses a clever bitwise approach for quick range operations.  
        These tools have practical uses, like enabling price filters on shopping sites such as Amazon, where customers can search within specific price ranges. Similarly, financial platforms use range queries to analyze stock trends over chosen periods. These structures balance speed and simplicity, making them vital for modern data-driven applications.</p>

        <h3>6. Differentiate between tree and graphs and their traversals. The applications of each.</h3>
        <p><span class="highlight"></span>
        <li>Trees: A connected, acyclic graph with n nodes and n-1 edges. Always has a root node. Is always connected and has no cycles.</li>
        <li>Graphs: A collection of vertices connected by edges, which can be cyclic or disconnected. Does not have a specific root unless explicitly defined. Can be either connected or disconnected and may include cycles.</li>
        <li>Tree Traversals: Pre-order, In-order, Post-order. Examples: Heaps, Binary Search Trees (BST) for efficient search, insertion, and deletion.</li>
        <li>Graph Traversals: DFS (Depth-First Search), BFS (Breadth-First Search). Examples: Road navigation, social networks, communication networks.</li>
        </p>

        <h3>7. Deliberate on sorting and searching algorithms, the technique behind each and how they connect to the real world.</h3>
        <p><span class="highlight"></span> Sorting algorithms arrange data in order (ascending/descending).  
        <li>1. Bubble Sort: Repeatedly compares and swaps adjacent elements.</li>  
        <li>2. Insertion Sort: Inserts elements into the sorted portion one by one.</li>
        <li>3. Selection Sort: Finds the smallest/largest element and places it in the sorted section.</li>
        <li>4. Merge Sort: Recursively splits and merges sorted halves.  </li>
        <li>5. Quick Sort: Partitions the array around a pivot for sorting.  </li>

        Applications:  
        - Database Management: Sorting for faster querying.  
        - E-commerce: Arranging products by price, ratings, etc.  

        Searching Algorithms:  
        - File Systems: Searching files in directories.  
        - Hash-Based Searches: Fast data retrieval using hash functions.</p>
        <h2>8. Discuss the importance of graph algorithms with respect to spanning trees and shortest paths.</h2>
        <p><span class="highlight"></span>Graph algorithms play a crucial role in solving problems related to traversal. To minimize traversal costs, algorithms like Kruskal’s and Prim’s are used to find the minimum spanning tree. These are commonly applied in areas such as laying cables, pipelines, and building networks. When the goal is to determine the shortest path, algorithms like Dijkstra and Floyd-Warshall come into play. These are vital for network routing, mapping, and other navigation tasks. By utilizing spanning trees and shortest path algorithms, efficiency is improved, and costs are reduced.</p>
        <h2>9. Discuss the different studied algorithm design techniques</h2>
        <p><span class="highlight"></span>
        Different algorithms studied:
        1. Backtracking: It involves exploring all possible solutions and pruning the ones that do not lead to a solution, learned with the example of the N-queens problem.
        <li>2. Sorting Algorithms:</li>
        <li>i. Divide and conquer: Quick and Merge Sort</li>
        <li>ii. Comparison-Based: Selection Sort, Insertion Sort, Bubble Sort.</li>
        <li>3. Brute force: Solving a problem by trying all possible solutions one-by-one.</li>
        <li>4. String search algorithms: i. Boyer-Moore ii. Knuth-Morris-Pratt iii. Rabin-Karp</li>
        <li>5. Shortest path algorithms: i. Dijkstra's ii. Floyd's iii. Warshall's v. Prim's</li>
