        <h2>Observing Algorithmic Patterns in Nature</h2>
        <h3>Iteration in Nature</h3>
        <p><span class="highlight">Example:</span> The recurring cycle of seasons is a perfect example of iteration. Like a loop in an algorithm, the progression from one season to the next happens repeatedly and predictably, much as a loop executes a set of instructions multiple times for different inputs.</p>
        <h3>Recursion in Nature</h3>
        <p><span class="highlight">Example:</span> The growth pattern of cabbage leaves, where new leaves form on top of older ones in layers, closely resembles recursion. Just like a recursive function that builds on smaller subproblems, each new layer of leaves is formed based on the previous ones, continuing the process until the plant reaches maturity.</p>
        <h3>Backtracking in Nature</h3>
        <p><span class="highlight">Example:</span> Ants searching for food provide a clear analogy for backtracking. Ants will explore various paths in search of food and, if unsuccessful, will backtrack to their nest to try a different route. This mirrors the backtracking approach in algorithms, where we explore possible solutions and retreat when a path doesnâ€™t lead to a solution, as in the case of solving puzzles like the N-Queens problem.</p>

        <h2>SDG Goal 11: Smart City Solutions</h2>
        <h3>Indicator Information</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><span class="highlight">Goal:</span> Make cities and human settlements inclusive, safe, resilient, and sustainable.</li>
            <li><span class="highlight">Target:</span> By 2030, provide access to safe, affordable, accessible, and sustainable transport systems for all, improving road safety, notably by expanding public transport.</li>
            <li><span class="highlight">Indicator:</span> Proportion of population that has convenient access to public transport, by sex, age, and persons with disabilities.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Smart Parking Systems</h3>
        <p><span class="highlight">Problem:</span> Traffic congestion due to inefficient parking space management and lack of real-time availability information.</p>
        <p><span class="highlight">Solution:</span> Smart parking systems that utilize technologies such as tries and queues to optimize parking availability and direct vehicles to open spots in real-time.</p>

        <h4>Parking Slot Availability using Trie</h4>
        <p><span class="highlight">Functionality:</span> A trie can store and retrieve available parking slots based on location and type (e.g., compact, regular, or handicapped) efficiently.</p>

        <h3>EV Charging Station Management</h3>
        <p><span class="highlight">Problem:</span> Efficiently managing EV charging stations to support the growing adoption of EVs and ensure optimal usage of charging resources.</p>

        <h4>Dynamic Queue for Real-time EV Slot Allocation</h4>
        <p><span class="highlight">Functionality:</span> A queue manages the order of vehicles waiting for an EV charging station slot, ensuring fair and timely access to charging resources.</p>
